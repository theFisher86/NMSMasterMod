# Recommended Mods
To ensure maximum compatibility A LOT of really awesome mods were removed from this mod pack.  Not because I don't think they're awesome but because they were one of multiple options and I don't want to restrict people by forcing them to use the mods I like.
 * A Flight Model Overhaul - there are many options but some of the most popular are:
   - SpaceFlight Overhaul by 03woodm
   - Darc Flight by Darconizer
   - Duds Sky by jasondude7116
 * Dark Space by jeveir- This makes the game look awesome but may cause performance issues.  If you add it and your FPS drops like crazy, bummer.
 * Everything Tradeable by Rapta - I think this is pretty cool but it dramatically changes how the game is played as you can buy/sell everything now.
 * More Ships Per System - Great for screenshots and is fantastic but it does mean that your univerese will be highly populated.  Also with NMS Master Mod, due to the landing pads on some of the Alien Structures models you may have a swarm of pilots flying around your planet if you're nearby an Alien Structure with landing pads.
 * No Mans Customs - I almost didn't remove this one because it's so great but not everyone may want an extra fast vehicle.  But I would almost say this is required, it makes the game so much more fun.
 * CJs Warp Mod - The warp effect in vanilla is stupid, this fixes that.
 * Better Landing - Allows you to see and land on landing pads from farther away.
